About (Short Description / Summary):

Flowchart using Voice Recognition is an Android app which is useful for drawing flowcharts using voice input from the user. This
reduces the effort for an individual of manually drawing flow charts. The user will have to just
speak out loudly the required shapes and the text to be displayed within the shape.
Ex:-If a user says ellipse then an ellipse will be displayed on the screen and it will further ask the user to
speak the text to be displayed within the ellipse.
Also once the diagram is completed it will be converted to an image and saved in the memory card on the device.
